  summary: A source connector for fetching papers from arXiv based on search queries.
  description: |-
    The arXiv connector fetches academic papers from the arXiv API based on configurable search queries.

    It supports filtering by categories, date ranges, and search terms. The connector can fetch paper metadata
    and optionally download PDF files. It's designed to work with arXiv's REST API and handles pagination
    and rate limiting automatically.

    Features:
    - Search by keywords, categories, and authors
    - Configurable polling intervals
    - PDF download support
    - Metadata extraction (title, abstract, authors, categories)
    - Position tracking for incremental updates
